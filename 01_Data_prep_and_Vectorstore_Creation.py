# MAGIC # Question Answering over Custom Datasets with 🦜️🔗 LangChain and MPT-7b-Instruct from MosaicML on Hugging Face 🤗 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Large Language Models produce some amazing results, chatting and answering questions with seeming intelligence. But how can you get LLMs to answer questions about _your_ specific datasets? Imagine answering questions based on your company's knowledge base, docs or Slack chats. The good news is that this is easy with open-source tooling and LLMs. This example shows how to apply [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html), Hugging Face `transformers`, and an open source LLM from MosaicML called [MPT-7b-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct). This example can make use of any text-generation LLM or even OpenAI with minor changes. In this case, the data set is a set of freely available published papers in PDF format about cystic fibrosis from PubMed, but could be any corpus of text.

# COMMAND ----------

# where you want the PDFs to be saved in your environment
dbutils.widgets.text("PDF_Path", "/dbfs/tmp/langchain_hls/pdfs")

# where you want the vectorstore to be persisted across sessions, so that you don't have to regenerate
dbutils.widgets.text("Vectorstore_Persist_Path", "/dbfs/tmp/langchain_hls/db")

# publicly accessible bucket with PDFs for this demo
dbutils.widgets.text("Source_Documents", "s3a://db-gtm-industry-solutions/data/hls/llm_qa/")

# where you want the Hugging Face models to be temporarily saved
hf_cache_path = "/dbfs/tmp/cache/hf"

# COMMAND ----------

#get widget values
pdf_path = dbutils.widgets.get("PDF_Path")
source_pdfs = dbutils.widgets.get("Source_Documents")
db_persist_path = dbutils.widgets.get("Vectorstore_Persist_Path")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ./util/install-prep-libraries

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Data Prep
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This data preparation need only happen one time to create data sets that can then be reused in later sections without re-running this part.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Grab the set of PDFs (ex: Arxiv papers allow curl, PubMed does not)
# MAGIC - We have are providing a set of PDFs from PubMedCentral relating to Cystic Fibrosis (all from [PubMedCentral Open Access](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/), all with the CC BY license), but any topic area would work
# MAGIC - If you already have a repository of PDFs then you can skip this step, just organize them all in an accessible DBFS location

# COMMAND ----------

import os
import shutil

# in case you rerun this notebook, this deletes the directory and recreates it to prevent file duplication
if os.path.exists(pdf_path):
  shutil.rmtree(pdf_path)
os.makedirs(pdf_path)

# slightly modifying the file path from above to work with the dbutils.fs syntax
modified_pdf_path = "dbfs:/" + pdf_path.lstrip("/dbfs")
dbutils.fs.cp(source_pdfs, modified_pdf_path, True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC All of the PDFs should now be accessible in the `pdf_path` now; you can run the below command to check if you want.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `!ls {pdf_path}`

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare Document DB
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now it's time to load the texts that have been generated, and create a searchable database of text for use in the `langchain` pipeline. 
# MAGIC These documents are embedded, so that later queries can be embedded too, and matched to relevant text chunks by embedding.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use `langchain` to reading directly from PDFs, although LangChain also supports txt, HTML, Word docs, GDrive, PDFs, etc.
# MAGIC - Create a simple in-memory Chroma vector DB for storage
# MAGIC - Instantiate an embedding function from `sentence-transformers`
# MAGIC - Populate the database and save it

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Prepare a directory to store the document database. Any path on `/dbfs` will do.

# COMMAND ----------

!(rm -r {db_persist_path} || true) && mkdir -p {db_persist_path}

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Create the document database:
# MAGIC - Here we are using the `PyPDFDirectoryLoader` loader from LangChain ([docs page](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/document_loaders/examples/pdf.html#using-pypdf)) to form `documents`; `langchain` can also form doc collections directly from PDFs, GDrive files, etc.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFDirectoryLoader

loader_path = f"{pdf_path}/"

pdf_loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(loader_path)
docs = pdf_loader.load()
len(docs)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Here we are using a text splitter from LangChain to split our PDFs into manageable chunks. This is for a few reasons, primarily:
# MAGIC - LLMs (currently) have a limited context length. MPT-7b-Instruct by default can only accept 2048 tokens (roughly words) in the prompt, although it can accept 4096 with a small settings change. This is rapidly changing, though, so keep an eye on it.
# MAGIC - When we create embeddings for these documents, an NLP creates a numerical representation (a high-dimensional vector) of that chunk of text that captures the semantic meaning of what is being embedded. If we were to embed large documents, the NLP model would need to capture the meaning of the entire document in one vector; by splitting the document, we can capture the meaning of chunks throughout that document and retrieve only what is most relevant.

# MAGIC - More info on Text Splitting with LangChain: [Text Splitters](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/text_splitters.html)
# MAGIC - Great article on [text chunking strategies for LLM apps](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) from Pinecone

# COMMAND ----------

# For PDFs we need to split them for embedding:
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    # Set a small chunk size, but this can change.
    chunk_size = 3000,
    chunk_overlap  = 500,
    length_function = len,
)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

# COMMAND ----------
