# MAGIC #
# MAGIC Construct a chain using LangChain such that when a user submits a question to the chain the following steps happen:
# MAGIC 1. Similarity search for your question on the vectorstore, i.e. ‚Äúwhich chunks of text have similar context/meaning as the question?‚Äù
# MAGIC 2. Retrieve the top `k` chunks
# MAGIC 3. Submit relevant chunks and your original question together to the LLM
# MAGIC 4. LLM answers the question with the relevant chunks as a reference
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will also need to define some critical parameters, such as which LLM to use, how many text chunks (`k`) to retrieve, and model performance parameters.

# MAGIC ## Building a `langchain` Chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now we can compose the database with a language model and prompting strategy to make a `langchain` chain that answers questions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Load Databricks Vector Search and define our retriever. We define `k` here, which is how many chunks of text we want to retrieve from the vectorstore to feed into the LLM
# MAGIC - Instantiate an LLM, loading from Databricks Model serving here, but could be other models or even OpenAI models
# MAGIC - Define how relevant texts are combined with a question into the LLM prompt

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# If running a Databricks notebook attached to an interactive cluster in "single user"
# or "no isolation shared" mode, you only need to specify the endpoint name to create
# a `Databricks` instance to query a serving endpoint in the same workspace.

# Otherwise, you can manually specify the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token
# or set `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively.
# You can set those environment variables based on the notebook context if run on Databricks

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Note that there are _many_ factors that affect how the language model answers a question. Most notable is the prompt template itself. This can be changed, and different prompts may work better or worse with certain models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The generation process itself also has many knobs to tune, and often it simply requires trial and error to find settings that work best for certain models and certain data sets. See this [excellent guide from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The settings that most affect performance are:
# MAGIC - `max_new_tokens`: longer responses take longer to generate. Reduce for shorter, faster responses
# MAGIC - `k`: the number of chunks of text retrieved into the prompt. Longer prompts take longer to process
# MAGIC - `num_beams`: if using beam search, more beams increase run time more or less linearly
